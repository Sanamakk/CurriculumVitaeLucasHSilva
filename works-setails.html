                              <p>This code is a data visualization application that utilizes the pandas, plotly.express, and streamlit libraries. The objective of the application is to display a sales dashboard with information such as total sales, average rating, sales by product line, and sales by hour. The application reads an Excel file and uses filters in the sidebar so that the user can select the city, customer type, and gender to view the corresponding data.</p>

                              <p>Through interactive bar, pie, and line charts, the user can easily visualize how sales are distributed by product line and by time of day, as well as check important information such as total sales and customer rating averages. The application is a useful tool for sales managers and decision-makers, as it allows them to quickly identify patterns and trends in sales data.</p>

                              <h2>How the code works</h2>
                              <p>The code starts by importing necessary libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Plotly and Graph_objs for creating graphs, and Streamlit for creating web applications. Then, it sets up the application page with a title, icon, and layout. </p>
                              <p>The "@st.cache" function is used to cache the result of reading an Excel file to avoid repetitive reading of unchanged data.</p>
                              <p>Next, data selection filters are created in a sidebar. These filters allow the user to select cities, customer types, and gender. Then, a query is executed on the Excel data based on these filters.</p>
                              <p>The main page displays three main performance indicators, such as total sales, average rating, and average sales per transaction. Then, the code creates two bar charts, one showing sales by product line and the other showing sales by hour. Additionally, a pie chart and a line chart are created for data visualization. The charts are plotted in two columns, with one chart in each column.</p>
                              <p>Finally, a "show_st_style" function is defined to display the Streamlit header, footer, and menu on the page.</p>

                              <ul>
                                <li>Sales by Product Line [Bar Chart]: This bar chart shows the total sales by product line. Each bar represents a product line, with the height of the bar indicating the total sales for that product line. The color of the bars is consistent and represents a color code for all bars in the chart.</li>
                                 <li>Sales by Hour [Bar Chart]: This bar chart shows the total sales for each hour of the day. The x-axis represents the hours of the day, and the y-axis represents the total sales for each hour. Each bar represents an hour, with the height of the bar indicating the total sales for that hour. The color of the bars is consistent and represents a color code for all bars in the chart.</li>
                                 <li>Sales by Product Line [Pie Chart]: This pie chart shows the percentage of total sales for each product line. Each slice represents a product line, with the size of the slice indicating the percentage of total sales for that product line. The legend on the right side of the chart provides information about the color of each slice.</li>
                                 <li>Sales by Hour [Line Chart]: This line chart shows the total sales for each hour of the day. The x-axis represents the hours of the day, and the y-axis represents the total sales for each hour. The line represents the total sales for each hour, with the trajectory of the line indicating the general trend of sales throughout the day.</li>

                              <p>The bar charts are divided into two panels, with the first showing sales by hour and the second showing sales by product line. Additionally, there are three KPIs at the top of the dashboard: Total Sales, Average Rating, and Average Sales Per Transaction. These provide summary information about the total sales, the average customer rating, and the average sales per transaction, respectively.</p>
